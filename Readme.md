My new toy project. A chess engine.

At this moment there is a not finished generic bitboard implementation.

### Utils

* `./run_cmake.sh` - runs cmake with DEBUG/RELEASE modes with out-of-source build with the build/(DEBUG|RELEASE) paths storing all created files
* `./run_tests.sh` - builds the tests target and runs it
